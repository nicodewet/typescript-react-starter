# Typescript React Starter

A quick start guide on how to wire up TypeScript with React.

Based on the [Microsoft Type Script React guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) with the following changes.

* Use yarn instead of npm

## Install create-react-app

An initial project structure will be generated by [facebookincubator's create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```
$ yarn global add create-react-app
```

## Create a new project

Create a new project in the current directory. Note if you already have a README.md it will get renamed.

```
$ create-react-app . --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

[Here](create-react-app-README.md) is the create-react-app generated README.md file for reference, of course renamed.
