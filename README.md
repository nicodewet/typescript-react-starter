# Typescript React Starter

A quick start guide on how to wire up TypeScript with React.

Based on the [Microsoft Type Script React guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) with the following changes.

* Use yarn instead of npm.
* Use Visual Studio Code.

Keep [Migrating from npm](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/) handy when using yarn.

## Install create-react-app

An initial project structure will be generated by [facebookincubator's create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```
$ yarn global add create-react-app
```

## Create a new project

Create a new project in the current directory. Note if you already have a README.md it will get renamed.

```
$ create-react-app . --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

[Here](create-react-app-README.md) is the create-react-app generated README.md file for reference, of course renamed.

Sanity check that the auto generation works.

```
$ yarn start
```

Take note of the following files and *effective conventions*:

* tsconfig.js - contains Typescript-specific options for our project such as compiler options, excludes and types.
* tslint.json - our linter, [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/), will be driven by settings in this file.
* package.json - naturally relevant dependencies and scripts (start, build, test, eject) that all use [react-scripts-ts](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).
* public folder - static assets (HTML page we'll deploy to, images). index.html must be kept.
* src folder - typescript and css code. index.tsx is our file's entry point and must be kept.

## Run and Test

```
yarn start
```

Runs the start scipt specified in package.json

```
$ yarn test
```

Runs [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), a testing utility (test runner), by filtering files with a .test.ts or .spec.ts extension. Have a quick look at the [Jest Getting Started Guide](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) if you have not used it before.

As with the *yarn start* command Jest will automatically run as soon as it detects changes. One way of working is to run both *yarn start* and *yarn test* concurrently in seperate terminal windows in order to both preview and test changes simultaneously.

Note that your test file, namely *App.text.tsx* is in the same directory as *App.test.tsx* which is different in terms of say the [Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) that Java developers may be accustomed to. We'll leave the structure as-is for now.

If you don't want to *watch* and tests and want to exit after a test run, as per the [create-react-apps docs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#continuous-integration) use the CI flag which would be used on a continous integration server.

```
$ CI=true yarn test
```
