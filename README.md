# Typescript React Starter

A quick start guide on how to wire up TypeScript with React.

Based on the [Microsoft Type Script React guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) with the following changes.

* Use yarn instead of npm.
* Use Visual Studio Code.

Keep [Migrating from npm](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/) handy when using yarn.

## Install create-react-app

An initial project structure will be generated by [facebookincubator's create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```
$ yarn global add create-react-app
```

## Create a new project

Create a new project in the current directory. Note if you already have a README.md it will get renamed.

```
$ create-react-app . --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

[Here](create-react-app-README.md) is the create-react-app generated README.md file for reference, of course renamed.

Sanity check that the auto generation works.

```
$ yarn start
```

Take note of the following files and *effective conventions*:

* tsconfig.js - contains Typescript-specific options for our project such as compiler options, excludes and types.
* tslint.json - our linter, [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/), will be driven by settings in this file.
* package.json - naturally relevant dependencies and scripts (start, build, test, eject) that all use [react-scripts-ts](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).
* public folder - static assets (HTML page we'll deploy to, images). index.html must be kept.
* src folder - typescript and css code. index.tsx is our file's entry point and must be kept.
